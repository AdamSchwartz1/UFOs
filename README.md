# UFOs

## Purpose
The goal of this analysis was to take the data set of UFO sightings and create an html webpage with a filterable table. To do this, I will use html, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## Results
For the final site, there are 5 filters that can be used - date, city, state, country, and the shape of the object. You can use as many of the filters as you want to narrow down your search. All searches need to be formatted exactly as the sample text is laid out. For example, if you enter the date as 01/01/2010 nothing will be returned. If you enter 1/1/2010, results will be filtered down and you will get table items. Also, the search is case sensitive, so nothing should be capitalized. After you enter the search criteria that you want, just hit 'enter' or 'return' on your keyboard and the results will be returned.

Here are some examples of searches:

- A search filtered down by date and city

- The same search as above but the city is capitalized, resulting in no output
